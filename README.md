This is my attempt to finish the work malprocrastination took on in 2014 with the Cuff and Collar customizer https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:528239. It's always been listed as a WIP, and a lot of code was commented out suggesting desired improvements and features.

Some of the features that I'm hoping to integrate are:
- Trying to implement modules that failed back in 2014 and were commented out of the original code
- Improved pin designs, including the possibility of pins taking a padlock
- Leash attachment point (particularly for collars)
- Allowing adjustments of cuff sizes in all three dimensions. I tweaked the code once to make a THICK collar, and not only did it come out amazing, but it made locking pins even better. Clearly this option will lead to some geometry shenanigans at extreme values, but hopefully a good variety of options can still be made
- Possible options for two line text on side one, allowing collars to have two lines on the front
- Alternative locking tabs on the side (for designs that can't take a padlock pin)

Some or most of these may not ultimately be implemented. I'm a beginner in OpenSCAD, so will have to learn a lot, and some of it may be beyond my understanding.

Original .scad file(s) is being saved here for archive purposes. Thingiverse has been more difficult for me to access of late, I'd rather such a resource not be lost.
