emboss_or_engrave 0 = emboss, 1 = engrave (now named as f_text_type and b_text_type)

go back to line 394 to add attachment_point module
new doc make_cuff_side_1 module: edit the 'writecylinder' script to allow 1 or 2 line text
new doc copy and adapt attachment_point module to create leash ring, place in make_cuff_side_1 module
when migrating full_round_with_text module, make sure to implement engrave/emboss checking on each side. Will probably double module length
correct any misspellings of 'rounded_cyliner' to 'rounded_cylinder'

needed modules:
full_round_with_text 786
full_round_cuff 753
mask_half 736
